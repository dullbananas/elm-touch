# elm-touch
This library is a wrapper around [Html.Events.Extra.Touch](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mpizenberg/elm-pointer-events/latest/Html-Events-Extra-Touch). It makes it very easy to handle multi finger movement and gestures by automatically managing multiple touches and calculating deltas behind the scenes.

You should see [this example](
https://github.com/dullbananas/elm-touch/blob/master/example) to understand how to use this library.
