# elm-touch
This library is a wrapper around touch events. It makes it very easy to handle multi finger movement and gestures by automatically managing multiple touches and calculating deltas behind the scenes.

You should see [this example](
https://github.com/dullbananas/elm-touch/blob/master/example) to understand how to use this library.
